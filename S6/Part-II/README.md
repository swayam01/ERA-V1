## Project Overview

This project is about building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. We're going to use a special type of machine learning model called a neural network, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This might sound complex, but don't worry! I'll guide you through it.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your computer. If you haven't done that yet, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This code also uses a library called PyTorch, which we will use to create our neural network. You can install it using pip, a package manager for Python, by typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Understanding the Code

### Neural Network (Net)

This is where we define our model. Think of it as a detective that has been trained to recognize and classify images of handwritten digits.

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    ...
```

We define several layers in our network. These layers are like filters that gradually learn different features of the digits from our images. For example, one layer might learn to recognize edges, while another might learn to recognize more complex shapes.

### Data Loading

This part of the code loads our dataset, which is a bunch of images of handwritten digits along with their correct labels (i.e., the actual digit each image represents).

```python
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(...)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(...)
```

The `train_loader` is the data we use to train our model, while the `test_loader` is used to evaluate how well our model has learned to classify digits.

### Training and Testing

The `train` function trains our model. It shows our model lots of examples and adjusts the model a little bit after each one, so it gradually gets better and better at recognizing digits.

The `test` function evaluates our model. It shows our model a bunch of examples it has never seen before and checks how many it gets right. This gives us an idea of how well our model would perform in the real world.

```python
def train(model, device, train_loader, optimizer, epoch):
    ...

def test(model, device, test_loader):
    ...
```

## How to Run the Code

To execute the code in the notebook from the terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Convert the notebook to a Python script (.py) file using the `jupyter nbconvert` command. Run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
jupyter nbconvert --to python ERA_S6.ipynb
```

2. This will generate a Python script file named `ERA_S6.py` in the same directory as your notebook.

3. Run the Python script from the terminal using the `python` command. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```shell
python ERA_S6.py
```
This will start the training process. You will see some output showing the model's progress. Once it's done, you'll see a message showing how well the model performed on the test data.

Make sure that you have Jupyter and its dependencies installed in your environment for this to work properly.

Note: The above commands assume that you are running them in the same directory as your notebook file (`ERA_S6.ipynb`). Adjust the commands accordingly if your notebook file is located in a different directory.
